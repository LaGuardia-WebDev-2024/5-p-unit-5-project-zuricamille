        Bryant Park has to be one of my favorite places to go around christmas
        time as a New York Resident. It's so pretty around this time of year and
        has things including;<br />
        -Holiday Shops: The market features over 150 boutique-style kiosks in
        custom-designed glass and metal booths. Vendors offer unique gifts,
        artisanal goods, holiday decorations, clothing, jewelry, and locally
        made products. It's a great spot for finding one-of-a-kind presents and
        supporting small businesses.<br />
        -Ice Skating Rink: The rink is free to use (bring your own skates),
        though skate rentals and locker services are available for a fee. The
        rink operates alongside the market and is a focal point of the Winter
        Village.<br />
        -Food and Drink: The market has plenty of food stalls offering festive
        treats, international cuisines, and beverages. Popular items include hot
        cocoa, mulled wine, pretzels, waffles, and holiday-themed desserts.
        There is a rink-side lounge and other spots to sit and enjoy the
        atmosphere.<br />
        -Seasonal Entertainment: Throughout the season, the market hosts live
        performances, holiday-themed events, and activities for kids. Carolers,
        musicians, and other entertainers add to the holiday spirit.<br />
